# Credit Risk Modeling Using Machine Learning in Banking

## Overview

In this project, we aim to revolutionize the credit lending strategies in the banking sector by leveraging the power of machine learning and data science. We will utilize real datasets to create models that can more accurately predict credit risk and enhance banks' current credit lending strategies.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop predictive models** to assess credit risk more accurately.
- **Enhance current lending strategies** by integrating data-driven approaches.
- **Utilize real datasets** to ensure the practical applicability and reliability of the models.

## Datasets

In this project, we are using two datasets:
- **CIBIL Dataset**
- **Internal Bank Dataset**

The combined dataset contains 88 features and 51,300 rows, providing a comprehensive foundation for building robust credit risk models.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather real-world datasets relevant to credit lending.
   - Ensure data quality and completeness.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and preprocess data.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and normalization.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform EDA to understand data patterns and distributions.
   - Visualize key insights and correlations.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features that can improve model performance.
   - Select the most relevant features for modeling.

5. **Model Development**
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
   - Train and validate models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.

7. **Model Deployment**
   - Deploy the best-performing model.
   - Integrate the model into the existing banking system for real-time credit risk assessment.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels, 
- **Tools**: Spyder, Git, GitHub

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, I have learned a lot about the banking industry, including concepts such as:
- Asset vs. Liability
- Net Interest Margin (NIM)
- Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) vs. Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA)
- And many more
